# About src/graphql

This directory contains a graphql schema (schema.graphql), that is fetched from Saleor API

Other directories contain fragments, mutations, queries and subscriptions, specific to your app

These graphql files are used by [graphql-codegen](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen),
which generates Typescript types and more
